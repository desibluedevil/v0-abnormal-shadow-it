# Abnormal AI - Shadow IT Security 

This repository contains an interactive Shadow IT detection and management dashboard built for the Abnormal AI – Senior Product Manager, Shadow IT Security Module take-home assignment. It showcases product thinking, UX flows, and a realistic security analyst / CISO experience for an AI-native cybersecurity platform.

**🧩 What This Prototype Does**

The app simulates an AI-powered Shadow IT Security Module that helps security teams:
- Discover unauthorized / risky OAuth apps connected to a SaaS tenant
- Assess risk using a Shadow IT Risk Score, scopes, vendor context, and user behavior
- Triage and remediate issues via guided workflows that don’t break productivity
- Give CISOs an executive-ready overview of risk posture and trends

It is meant as a product + UX demo, not a production detection engine.
